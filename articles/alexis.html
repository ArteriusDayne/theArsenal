                <p>Arsene Wenger says Arsenal are working hard to tie down Alexis Sanchez to a new long-term contract and that he still has time on his hands as negotiations continue.</p>
                <p>The Chile international took his season’s goal tally to 10 with a decisive brace against Bournemouth on Saturday and completed his third full game in a row since returning from international duty where it was thought he may have a hamstring problem.<p> 
                <p>The 27-year-old’s man-of-the-match performance led to fulsome praise from the boss, who said afterwards:</p>
                <blockquote>“Even when he looks dead, he’s still alive and always finds the resources to do something special."</blockquote>
                <blockquote>“He has that conditioning which allows him to always find an extra gear to be dangerous."</blockquote>
                <blockquote>“It [his contract] is important. How important it is, I don’t know – we will not sort it tonight. We have some time in front of us.”</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Asked whether the striker was growing more expensive to keep with every goal, Wenger also joked: “Well, you like us to spend money, so you should be happy!”</blockquote>
